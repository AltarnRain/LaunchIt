## WORK IN PROGRESS!

The plan here is to create a program that can shut down services and executables before starting a game in a given priority.

## Uhm, why? There's plenty of programs that do this.

I know! But name one program that doesn't install a service itself or remains in memory?

For example, I installed Razer Cortex which does exactly what I want. Well... mostly.

So why not Razer Cortex? 

Namely, it installs a service it needs to do its job. My plan is to allow you to figure out which services 
you can shutdown that stay shut down while running a game and when you're happy you'll get a batch file to start your game
the way you want.
