# LaunchIt

LaunchIt is a program that shuts down anything you don't need before starting a program.
This can by anything but I wrote it with games in mind.

## Uhm, why? There's plenty of programs that do this.

I know! But none of them offered what I wanted.

I used a batch file with 'net stop' and 'taskkill' commands a long time but what I could do with such a batch file was limited.

For example: stubborn services and executables that restart! Arghh!

Try shutting down 'Windows Search' and see how quickly it is restarted. Very annoying.

But thanks to LaunchIt I found out the reboot of 'Windows search' was triggered by Explorer.exe. And that's just one example, there's plenty more.

Because of this LaunchIt has a configuration option to shutdown explorer.exe.
